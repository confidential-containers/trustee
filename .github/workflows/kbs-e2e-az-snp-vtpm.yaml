  # Note on repository checkout: pull_request_target sets `GITHUB_SHA` to the
  # "last commit on the PR base branch", meaning that by default `actions/checkout`
  # is going to checkout the repository main branch. In order to pick up the pull
  # request code, this workflow uses the `github.event.pull_request.head.sha`
  # property to get the last commit on the HEAD branch. One limitation of this approach
  # is that, unlike the `pull_request` event, the checked pull request isn't necessarily
  # rebased to main (so it is up to the workflow to ensure the pull request is rebased
  # **before* the workflow is triggering)
