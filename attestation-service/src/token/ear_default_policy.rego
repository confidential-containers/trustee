# This policy validates multiple TEE platforms
# The policy is meant to capture the TCB requirements
# for confidential containers.

# This policy is used to generate an EAR Appraisal.
# Specifically it generates an AR4SI result.
# More informatino on AR4SI can be found at
# <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-rats-ar4si/>

# For the `executables` trust claim, the value 33 stands for
# "Runtime memory includes executables, scripts, files, and/or
#  objects which are not recognized."

# "A Verifier does not recognize an Attester's hardware or
#  firmware, but it should be recognized."
