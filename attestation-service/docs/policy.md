# Attestation Policy (Developing)

CoCo AS provides a flexible policy support based on Rego to facilitate the customized verification rules.

## How to Use Policy

For both [gRPC CoCo AS](../protos/attestation.proto) and [Restful CoCo AS](./restful-as.md), we have a
parameter named `policy_ids` to specify which policies to use to enforce the evidence check.

For a running CoCoAS, we can set any new policies.

Let's give some quick guides.

### gRPC CoCo AS

Firstly, start a gRPC CoCo AS
```shell
cd attestation-service/tests/e2e
make grpc.pid
```

Then, set a new policy to the CoCo AS.
We have prepared an [example SetPolicy request](../tests/coco-as/policy/grpc-set-policy.json) with [policy](../tests/coco-as/policy/new_policy.rego) and policy id `example-policy`. The policy should be `Base64 URL SAFE NO PAD` encoded.

```shell
REQ=$(cat ../../tests/coco-as/policy/grpc-set-policy.json)
grpcurl \
  -plaintext \
  -import-path ../../protos \
  -proto ../../protos/attestation.proto \
  -d @ 127.0.0.1:50004 attestation.AttestationService/SetAttestationPolicy <<EOF
$REQ
EOF
```

Then, we can use the policy to check against an evidence. We use the [request](../tests/coco-as/policy/grpc-check.json) to do this.

```shell
REQ=$(cat ../../tests/coco-as/policy/grpc-check.json)
grpcurl \
  -plaintext \
  -import-path ../../protos \
  -proto ../../protos/attestation.proto \
  -d @ 127.0.0.1:50004 attestation.AttestationService/AttestationEvaluate <<EOF
$REQ
EOF
```

### Restful CoCo AS

Firstly, start a Restful CoCo AS
```shell
cd attestation-service/tests/e2e
make restful.pid
```

Then, set a new policy to the CoCo AS.
We have prepared an [example SetPolicy request](../tests/coco-as/policy/restful-set-policy.json) with [policy](../tests/coco-as/policy/new_policy.rego) and policy id `example-policy`. The policy should be `Base64 URL SAFE NO PAD` encoded.

```shell
curl -k -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/policy \
     -i \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d @../../tests/coco-as/policy/restful-set-policy.json
```

Then, we can use the policy to check against an evidence. We use the [request](../tests/coco-as/policy/grpc-check.json) to do this.

```shell
curl -k -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/attestation \
     -i \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d @../../tests/coco-as/policy/restful-check.json
```

## How to Write a Policy (Experimental)

:warning: **Warning:** The policy feature is still under development and it might be changed flexibly before we get a stable version.

We will introduce the format of policy by providing some examples to show the use cases.

1. The [default policy](../attestation-service/src/policy_engine/opa/default_policy.rego). This policy will check whether each entry in the [parsed claims](./parsed_claims.md) generated by the input evidence matches the reference value obtained from RVPS.
2. An [SGX policy](../tests/coco-as/policy/example-1.rego). The client want to ensure the `mr_signer` and `mrenclave` are both expected value.
3. A [TDX policy](../tests/coco-as/policy/example-2.rego). The client want to ensure the TDX module (reflected by `tdx.quote.body.mr_seam`), guest firmware (reflected by `tdx.quote.body.mr_td`), kernel (reflected by `tdx.ccel.kernel`) are all as expected.
