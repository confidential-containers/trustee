This directory contains sample policy files to configure the policy engine
of the KBS. You can use these files to write your own policies.

|[allow_all.rego](./allow_all.rego)|Equivalent to turning off the policy engine. Release resources unconditionally|
|[deny_all.rego](./deny_all.rego)|Deny all resources release|
